### November 6th, 2018 (Week 5)

Today is the PCB soldered milestone, as per my [project schedule](https://github.com/six0four/ceng317/blob/master/rubrics/Week3RubricforProjectSchedule.xml) I am on track since I have worked on this for the last few weeks. As per my [project proposal](https://github.com/six0four/ceng317/blob/master/documentation/ProposalContentStudentNameRev02.pdf) I proposed connecting to the BME280, PCF8591, and the DS2321, the sockets for these were incorporated into the PCB accordingly. I found [a site that was helpful for the BME 280](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2016/07/using-bme280-i2c-temperature-pressure-sensor-in-python/). Regarding my financial status, my [budget](https://github.com/six0four/MicroRover/raw/master/PartsFor20MicroRoversRev02.xlsx) included headers but not the stackable one which I still need to go and get. This will be an added expense of [$5.65 plus tax and time/mileage](https://www.creatroninc.com/product/stackable-header-for-raspberry-pi/). I received feedback on the first Gerber files that were sent for production and thus improved them and here is an image of the resulting soldered PCB ([Fritzing file available](https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/blob/master/electronics/StudentSenseHatV06.fzz)) that was completed well in adavance of this milestone:
